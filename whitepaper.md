## Abstract

The PolyBread organization is composed of three main components:
    *PolyBread DAO
    *PolyBread Token
    *PolyBread NFT (PbNFT)


prototyping(unf - 5/26/21): PolyBread NFT (PbNFT)
The PolyBread NFT (PbNFT) is an ERC721 contract on the Polygon/Matic blockchain. This "NFT" is minted by users of the PolyBread dApp and contains metadata for the ipfs pin to the artwork + artist data. 


prototyping(unf - 5/26/21): PolyBread Token
The PolyBread Token ("PYBD") is a ERC20 "token" contract on the Polygon/Matic blockchain. It serves as a governance token for the PolyBread DAO and offers other utility within the PolyBread dApp ecosystem, such as NFT airdrops to holders, and access to enhanced features within the dApp. Voting rights are granted to holders of the PYBD token, delegated by routine snapshots. There is a maximum total supply of 10,000 PYBD tokens minted when the contract is deployed on mainnet. 5% of the original supply will be distributed to a select few members of our internal community of artists. LP delegation and other tokenomics will be decided upon by the DAO.



prototyping(unf - 5/26/21): PolyBread DAO
The DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization designed to sustainably develop a diversified portfolio of crypto-assets and accrue value for DAO members.  Individuals can join the DAO at any time by buying DAO tokens, subject to a bonding curve to maintain incentive-alignment with risk profile. Members can exit the DAO at any time by selling DAO tokens via the same mechanism, thereby offering individual liquidity while ensuring security for members. The capital pool is managed through inflation and burning mechanisms: portfolio projects receive investment as newly-minted DAO tokens, and DAO tokenholders can always burn the DAO token against the bonding curve to obtain the underlying capital (ETH, WBTC, etc.) less a liquidity discount. This enables the DAO token to be a ‘stabler’ coin, collateralized by an underlying basket of high quality crypto-assets.

## Principles

As with any organization that is ['built to last'](http://www.wikisummaries.org/wiki/Built_to_Last), the DAO sets forth a set of inalienable principles that guides overall strategy along with the individual activities of members and related leagues.
